            <div class="">
                <p>Color is an essential tool because it has an impact on how we think and behave. Color directs our eye where to look, what to do, and how to interpret something. It puts content into context. It helps us decide what’s important and what’s not.</p>
                <p>While color psychology has been studied and analyzed over time, the psychological impact of color is still moderately subjective. We don’t all react the same way to colors, as we all have previous experiences with colors from significant events, cultures, people, and memories. However, there are a few generalities about how people respond to color, and that’s what we’re going to look at.</p>

                <h2>The Color Psychology of Blue</h2>
                <p>Blue is known for its trust and dependability. It’s reliable, responsible, and mentally soothing. For that reason alone, it’s one of the most-liked colors across the entire world. Unlike red, blue lends a more mental reaction rather than physical that allows us to destress, calm down, and think of the most ideal situation. Unfortunately, it also is one of the last colors to be seen, and can be perceived as distant, cold, or unfriendly if used it great amounts. Overall, blue is a well-liked color that can bring a sense of calmness and trust when building relationships.</p>
                <div class="uso"><p><strong>Blue is commonly seen:</strong> Workout facilities, hospitals, and spas.</p></div>
                
                <h2>The Color Psychology of Black</h2>
                <p>Black is a color of sophistication, seriousness, control, and independence. Although, it can also be used to show evil, mystery, depression, and even death. Black is a very reserved color that completely lacks any light as its an absence of all the colors. It likes to stay hidden, in control, and separate from others. For this reason, black is a great color for high contrast and easy legibility. Unfortunately, since its a very powerful color, too much black can cause sadness and overall negativity so use it sparingly and in your text more so than the visuals itself.</p>
                <div class="uso"><p><strong>Black is commonly seen:</strong> Professional attire, luxury products, and limos.</p></div>
                
                <h2>The Color Psychology of Red</h2>
                <p>Red is a very powerful, dynamic color that reflects our physical needs whether to show affection and love, or to portray terror, fear, and survival. Red is also a very energizing color that can portray friendliness and strength, but can also be demanding and show aggression depending on its context. Overall, if you’re looking to have a really powerful presence or get someone’s attention fast, red is your go-to color. Just remember to use it sparingly to avoid the extreme negative reactions it can so easily awaken</p>
                <div class="uso"><p><strong>Red is commonly seen:</strong> Stop lights, Valentine’s Day, and horror films.</p></div>
                
                <h2>The Color Psychology of Green</h2>
                <p>Green is a color of balance and harmony. It lends us a clearer sense of right from wrong since green incorporates a balance of both the logical and emotional. Green is one of the most-seen colors in nature reflecting life, rest, and peace. It is also a sign of growth, whether that’s in a physical object like plants or in our income and wealth.</p>
                <div class="uso"><p><strong>Green is commonly seen:</strong> Nature, economic exchange, health-based stores, and restaurants.</p></div>
